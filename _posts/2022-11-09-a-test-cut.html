<p>I knew i'd need to at some point bring my media into a video editor, but i'd initially assumed I'd used Final Cut Pro, because I have the most experience with it. Today it hit me that, instead I should consider Blender's built-in Video Editor. No it's not the most robust solution, but it's free and i'm already intend on leaning heavily on Blender for animation production, so why not! </p>

<p>After a watching a few videos on Blender's Video Editor on youtube, i jumped in and started pulling in the generated voice audio to start sequencing them.</p>

<p>Here's the result of that test:</p>

<p>Conclusion? I think this could work out with some more practice editing in Blender.</p>
